Random thoughts on the year of my best body, May 2016\.

* **May 2**: I have my next DEXA scan scheduled for June 1\. I need to buckle down and get serious! I feel like the past couple of months, I've gone a little crazy with all the cheat meals on the weekend. It was originally one cheat meal; it's evolved to like a cheat lunch followed by a cheat dinner followed by multiple cheat desserts. I'm ruining all the good progress I make during the week, where I eat super clean! Okay, time to get focused.
* **May 5**: I am feeling some serious right forearm pain after today's clean lunge jump move. And once again, I think, which move caused the pain? I am thinking it _might _be the Pilates workout's bird dog press, where I might have tried harder to extend my arm? Not sure. But the right forearm pain has happened before. Next time I might have to do the clean lunge jump without weights. :(
* **May 6**: I finally broke through to the 110s in my weekly weigh-in! I can't believe it. What did I do different this week? Hmmm, let me see. I guess there were a few things: 1) I did one 15-minute HIIT session on the treadmill on Monday, and 2) I went cold turkey off my nightly 2 pieces of Endangered Species dark chocolate since they're not 21 Day Fix-approved foods. Could either or both those things have made the difference?
* **May 21**: trying to taper off water just a little bit, getting tired of going to the bathroom every 20 minutes :D. My normal consumption is 12-13 cups, yesterday I went with around 10 cups.
